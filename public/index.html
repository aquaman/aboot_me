  <h2>Aboot me</h2>
  <p>My name is Paul and I'm from Canada, eh. I am a Software Testing and QA Consultant. I test so good you may be blinded by the awesomeness. I can help you be a great Tester too if you want to learn.</p>
  
  <p><i>(BTW, while I am from Canada, I don't say "aboot" and I don't know anyone who does. I'm playing to the stereotypes here.)</i></p>
  
  <h2>What is this page?</h2>
  <p>I am on a grand adventure. I am infiltrating Software Development by learning to create my own web apps. I am creating these pages as I go. Don't expect them to stick around. I may have already forgotten that this is here.</p>

  <p>Some books I currently have on the go include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>19th and 20th century science fiction</li>
    <li>Management 3.0</li>
    <li>Lean Startup</li>
  </ul>
  <p>..and I am writing a book too..</p>
